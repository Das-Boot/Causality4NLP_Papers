## Causality Applied to NLP
- (NeurIPS 2020 Oral) Causal Mediation Analysis for Interpreting Neural NLP:
The Case of Gender Bias [[PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.12265.pdf)]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cause: input text, mediator: some neurons, effect: output prediction

- (ACL 2020) Text and Causal Inference: A Review of Using Text to Remove Confounding from Causal Estimates [[PDF]](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.474.pdf)

- (arXiv 2020) Causal Effects of Linguistic Properties [[PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.12919.pdf)]


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cause: binary writer intent, confounder: other linguistic habits of the writer, mediator: text by the writer, effect: reader's response time

## Addressing "Confounders" in NLP
- (EMNLP 2019) Topics to Avoid: Demoting Latent Confounds in Text Classification [[PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.00453.pdf)]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cause: native language, confounder: topic, effect: text

- (EMNLP 2018, Stanford) Deconfounded lexicon induction for interpretable social science
